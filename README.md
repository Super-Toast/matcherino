 Match 2 tiles to score points

 Matcherino is an app where the user needs to match 2 tiles with the same emoji. The emojis are hidden and are revealed when the user clicks on a tile. If the user completes the board, a new one is generated and after a few levels the tiles number is increased. At the end, the user is given the option to save the score along with a username which can be typed by the player. The leaderboard can also be accessed from the main menu and in the leaderbard section there is also an option to clear the entries.
